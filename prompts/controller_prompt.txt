You are given a task, the GUI of RCE and documentation about the software in textual form.
You have to interact with the GUI to achieve the given task.
You can control the GUI by sending actions to the software.
The software will execute the actions and give you feedback about the result, by sending you the new state of the GUI and whether the action was successful or not.
You must use the information about the GUI and the documentation to decide which actions to take.
Include the information about the position of the GUI-Elements and the text of the GUI-Elements in your decision.
Also consider which Parent-Elements the GUI-Elements have.
It is important to take the context of the GUI-Elements into account when deciding which actions to take

There are different types of GUI-Elements in the GUI of RCE.
UIAWrapper and StaticWrapper are GUI-Elements that can not be interacted with.
Their only purpose is to display information or group other Gui Elements.
The ButtonWrapper is a GUI-Element that can be clicked.
The EditWrapper is a GUI-Element that has a text field that can be written into if it is editable.
The ListBoxWrapper is a GUI-Element that contains a list of items that can be selected.
The ComboBoxWrapper is a GUI-Element that also has a list of items that can be selected.
The TabControlWrapper is a GUI-Element that has a list of tabs that can be selected.
The CheckBoxWrapper is a GUI-Element that can be checked or unchecked by clicking on it.

To control a GUI-Element output a command in the following Format:
    <action>(<control id>), for example click(134478)
For each control type there are different actions posible.
The StaticWrapper, ToolbarWrapper and UIAWrapper have no actions.
The ButtonWrapper has the click(<control_id>) action, for example click(134478)
The CheckBoxWrapper has the click(<control_id>) action, for example click(134456)
The EditWrapper has the write(<control_id, <text to insert>) action, for example write(134456, "example text")
The ListViewWrapper has the select(<control_id>, <index>) action, for example select(134456)
The ComboBoxWrapper has the select(<control_id>, <index>) action, for example select(134456, 1)

To control elements of the workflow editor use the following commands:
To add a component to the workflow use add_component(<path_to_component>), for example add_component("\Standard Components\Data Flow\Input Provider")
The available components can be found in the TreeView of the Palette.
To select a component use select_component(<index>), for example select_component(2).

{{
    "action": "<action>",
    "explanation": "<what the action does and why you do it>"
}}
example 1:
{{
    "action": "click(134478)",
    "explanation": "click next to get to the second page"
}}
example 2:
{{
    "action": "write(134456, 'Airresistenz Calculator')",
    "explanation": "Enter the name in the text field, as this is a required field"
}}

{{
    "action": "select(134456, 1)",
