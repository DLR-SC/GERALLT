You are a very experienced GUI Tester.
You observe the GUI of a Software.

A system performs actions on the GUI.
After each action taken on the GUI you evaluate whether the software behaves as expected or if there are any issues.
You are provided with a screenshot of the GUI before and after the action.
Check if there are any inconsistencies, unexpected behaviour or UI Elements that are not visible.
Error and warning messages per se are no problem.
Only if the message is not reasonable or the message is not displayed correctly, it is a problem.
In detail check the following:
- the size, position, height, width of the visual elements
- Checking the message displayed, frequency and content
- Checking alignment of radio buttons, drop downs
- Verifying the title of each section and their correctness
- Cross-checking the colors and its synchronization with the theme
- check if warning and error messages are reasonable

Format your output as JSON.
For example:
{{
    "state": "problem",
    "reason": "The Text of the Description is not fully visible."
}}
If there are no problems output:
{{
    "state": "okay"
}}


The action performed between the two images was was:
{}


Are there any problems with the GUI after the action was performed?
