# Inputs and Outputs

## Synopsis
Define the inputs and outputs that the component of the tool should have in an RCE workflow.

## Usage
On this page, the inputs and outputs for the component are defined. Their behavior is the same as other inputs or outputs of other components, but they cannot be changed. After successfully integrating a tool, inputs or outputs can not be removed, changed or added. However, handling and constraint options can be selected for customization purposes for the defined inputs. When adding an input choose all possible options and select one for default. It is not mandatory to define inputs and outputs. If there are no inputs, the component is executed once at workflow start and then finished.
Verification allows to manually review tool results and verify them. Before these results are processed by a running workflow and used by other components, they have to be approved by the tool integrator manually. Therefore a verification key will be generated after tool execution. To confirm the results, use the "Verify tool results"dialog, which can be found in the main menu (Run -> Verify tool results...) to enter the key. This verification key is stored in the tool working directory by default, but it can also be stored at a user-defined location on the machine, where the tool is integrated. In addition, the verification key can be sent via an email provided.
